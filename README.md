Social-Skater
=============
Social Skater is a social media outlet designed for skateboarders and longboarders alike. For most avid skaters, traveling without your skateboard is a necessity. The only thing is they aren't always sure if there's a skate spot waiting for them at their destination. Social Skater allows users to post up pictures, videos, and reviews of their favorite spots online and share them with people across the country. This creates an online basis to spread the stoke of skateboarding.

Users can also connect with other skaters by liking and commenting on their posts, and also messaging them personally. This lets people to meet up with other local skaters, based on their style of riding, at their favorite skate spots.People that are worried about "blowing up" their spot can use a feature that allows them create "secret spots" and only share them with skaters of their choosing. 

Skaters can post videos for each spot and compete for best trick or best line. Challenges can be set at each spot by skaters that have previously been there using videos (best trick overgap, longest slide, longest grind, etc..). All of a user's posts are compiled onto their own personal page to use as a portfolio to gain notoriety and maybe even sponsorships.
